# 3D Models for AI Friend

This directory should contain the following 3D model files:

1. `robot_head.glb` - A futuristic robot head model with articulated jaw for speaking animations
2. `female_head.glb` - A stylized female character head with facial animation capabilities 
3. `male_head.glb` - A stylized male character head with facial animation capabilities

If these files are not present, the application will fall back to emoji placeholders in the UI.

## Getting 3D Models

You can obtain free or paid 3D models from various sources:
- SketchFab (https://sketchfab.com)
